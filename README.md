# interstellar-engduino
Arcade-style 2D shooter controlled by the accelerometer on the "Engduino" microcontroller (a modified version of the Arduino board
made by the UCL Department of Engineering), built in C++ and Java.

This program consists of two parts. The "interstellar_engduino.ino" file in the "engduino_code" directory should be compiled with
the Arduino-Engduino IDE and uploaded to the Engduino. The .pde file in the "display_code" directory, meanwhile, should be run and/or
built through the Processing IDE.
